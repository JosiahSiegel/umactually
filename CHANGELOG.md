## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Native Anthropic Messages API provider (PR #31)**: third
  provider family alongside `openai-compatible` and `copilot`. Wire
  shape is the Anthropic Messages schema (`POST /v1/messages`,
  `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`, top-level `system`,
  user-only `messages[]`, `max_tokens` instead of `max_output_tokens`).
  URL resolver follows the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` convention — preserves
  the operator's path prefix — so Anthropic-protocol gateways mounted
  under arbitrary prefixes route correctly. The `--provider anthropic`
  default base URL is `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`; `api-url` is
  optional for this provider (override for self-hosted Anthropic-protocol
  gateways like MiniMax).
- **URL-aware defaults in `parseFallbackModels` (PR #29)**: the
  `model: "auto"` resolver picks the right per-provider model from the
  hostname pattern. `gpt-5-mini` for `openai-compatible`, `claude-sonnet-4.6`
  for Anthropic endpoints, `claude-3-5-sonnet` for Copilot (4.6 is not
  Copilot-routable), `gemini-2.5-flash` for Google, `MiniMax-M3` for
  MiniMax. Per the Vectara HHEM 2026-05-11 leaderboard.
- **Cross-protocol auto-discovery on dual-protocol gateways (PR #32)**:
  the dispatcher transparently retries the OTHER provider family at the
  same `UMACTUALLY_API_URL` when the named provider returns a routing-level
  rejection (404). Documented use case: [MiniMax](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/token-plan/claude-code)
  serves both Anthropic-protocol (`/anthropic/v1/messages`) and
  OpenAI-protocol (`/v1/responses`) under the same hostname with the same
  API key. Operators no longer have to guess which protocol lives under
  which path prefix — `--provider` becomes advisory. Fallback is strictly
  bounded to 404 (payload 400 / parse / auth / network errors do NOT
  trigger fallback — those have a single root cause). See
  [`docs/providers.md`](docs/providers.md#cross-protocol-auto-discovery-the-dispatcher).
- **Path-prefix heuristic for `/anthropic` URLs (PR #34)**: the cross-
  protocol fallback in PR #32 only fires AFTER the named provider's URL
  candidate loop exhausts. On MiniMax-style dual-protocol gateways the
  openai-compatible loop successfully degrades `/anthropic` to
  origin+`/v1` (where MiniMax also serves OpenAI), so the dispatcher
  never reached the fallback and silently routed an
  `UMACTUALLY_API_URL=https://api.minimax.io/anthropic` to OpenAI at
  `/v1/responses` — wrong protocol. Fix: a new heuristic in the
  dispatcher checks whether any path segment in the operator's URL
  exactly equals `anthropic` (case-insensitive, byte-for-byte). When
  true, the dispatcher commits to the Anthropic Messages API client
  regardless of `--provider`, with a `::notice::` annotation for
  operator audit. Conservative by design — false negatives still fall
  through to cross-protocol fallback; false positives are bounded to
  exact-segment matches so `anthropic-v2` and `my-anthropic` do NOT
  trigger. See
  [`docs/providers.md`](docs/providers.md#path-prefix-heuristic-the-anthropic-url--anthropic-protocol-commit).
- **New `docs/providers.md`**: canonical end-to-end reference for the
  provider layer — per-family URL resolution rules, the
  Anthropic-protocol path-prefix preservation contract (with the
  `@anthropic-ai/sdk` / `anthropic-sdk-kotlin` references), the
  cross-protocol dispatcher decision tree, the dual-protocol gateway
  matrix (MiniMax, LiteLLM, Portkey patterns), and model
  auto-resolution per hostname. The page a fresh dev reads first when
  touching anything in `src/util/url.ts` or
  `src/cli/live-provider.ts`.

### Changed

- **Anthropic URL helper now preserves operator path prefixes
  (PR #32)**: the previous `resolveProviderBaseUrl(baseUrl, "/v1")`
  stripped the operator's path and always substituted `/v1`, which
  silently 404'd MiniMax-style Anthropic-protocol gateways under path
  prefixes. The new `resolveAnthropicMessagesUrl(baseUrl)` in
  `src/util/url.ts` appends `/v1/messages` per the official
  `@anthropic-ai/sdk` convention without stripping the operator's
  path. Query string and fragment are now stripped before appending
  (prevents `.../v1?token=abc/v1/messages`-style URL malformation).
- **`redactUrlForLog` helper (PR #32)**: strips query string and
  fragment from URLs before they enter `::notice::` action annotations
  (which persist in GitHub Actions run logs). Three log sites in
  `src/provider/openai-compatible.ts` and two in
  `src/cli/live-provider.ts` route through the helper. Pinned by
  `test/unit/redact-url-for-log.test.ts`. Operators who accidentally
  (or maliciously) type a URL with a `?token=` parameter no longer
  leak the token into the persisted CI annotation log.
- **LLM citation grounding (PR #26)**: layered defense against LLM
  path/line fabrication. Five layers, each closing a different
  failure mode observed in PR #56 (a 122-line source-only diff that
  produced 8 dist/-fabrication findings on the ADO policy review):
  1. **Diff filter** — `src/diff/filter-build-artifacts.ts` strips
     `dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, lockfiles, `*.min.js`,
     `*.map`, etc. on BOTH the GitHub REST-diff path and the
     Azure REST-reconstruction path. Centralizes what was a
     shell-side `':!dist'` on Azure only.
  2. **System-prompt rewrite** — `src/cli/provider-prompts.ts` now
     documents the strict JSON schema, the diff path enum, the
     quote-first workflow (Anthropic pattern: copy the diff lines
     that justify a finding BEFORE emitting it), and the positive
     constraint (cite only what's in the Files-in-diff list).
  3. **Wire-format `response_format: json_schema`** — the strict
     schema is sent on the wire to providers that support it.
     `--strict-schema` (default ON) / `--no-strict-schema`.
  4. **Parse-warnings artifact** — every off-diff or off-line
     finding the model emitted is now recorded in
     `artifacts/manual/*.parse-warnings.json` (sibling to the
     main review artifact). Pinned by a regression test
     (`test/unit/parse-warnings.test.ts`) that locks the exact
     8-fabrication count from PR #56.
  5. **Model auto-resolver** — `model: "auto"` no longer passes
     through verbatim. Resolves to `gpt-5-mini` (OpenAI),
     `claude-sonnet-4.6` (Anthropic), `claude-3-5-sonnet`
     (Copilot — the 4.6 string is NOT Copilot-routable and
     would 404, so Copilot uses the 3.5 Sonnet line), or
     `gemini-2.5-flash` (Google) based on the active provider +
     `UMACTUALLY_API_URL`. Per the Vectara HHEM 2026-05-11
     leaderboard, these models have HHEM 5-11% vs the
     9-23% of gpt-4o/o3/o4-mini that the prior default fell back to.
  6. **Deterministic verify-findings filter** — defense-in-depth
     re-runs the (path, line) filter on the model's `comments[]`
     before posting. Default ON. `--verify-findings` /
     `--no-verify-findings`. Critically, the parse-warnings
     artifact is built from the PRE-verify review so it captures
     every fabrication event (the inline filter is a defense
     in depth, not a replacement for the artifact).
- New CLI flags: `--strict-schema`, `--no-strict-schema`,
  `--verify-findings`, `--no-verify-findings`. Both default to
  ON. Both are no-ops when the provider doesn't support
  `response_format: json_schema`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `ignore-minor` input removed.
  The `ignore-minor` action input, CLI flag, and `UMACTUALLY_IGNORE_MINOR` /
  `REVIEW_IGNORE_MINOR` env vars have been removed. Use `minimum-severity`
  (`low|medium|high`, default `medium`) instead — it covers the same
  "suppress minor findings" use case with finer control. The previous
  guarantee that `security` and `leak` findings are never suppressed now
  lives inside `minimum-severity`'s semantics and applies regardless of
  the configured threshold.
  - CLI: `--ignore-minor` / `--no-ignore-minor` throw `CliUsageError`
    with a migration message — fail loudly is intentional so explicit
    CLI callers can't silently miss the change.
  - Env vars: silently ignored. CI users who still have
    `UMACTUALLY_IGNORE_MINOR` / `REVIEW_IGNORE_MINOR` set will see a
    one-time stderr warning on the next run pointing them at
    `minimum-severity`. The asymmetry with the CLI is deliberate: env
    vars are inherited invisibly and a hard throw on every run would
    brick pipelines that simply forgot to clean up.
  - Action users who were on the previous defaults
    (`ignore-minor: false`, `minimum-severity: low`) will lose
    `info` findings that were previously posted inline; that
    matches the new `minimum-severity: medium` default. Set
    `minimum-severity: low` explicitly to keep the old
    "show everything" behavior.
  - Pipelines that were passing `ignore-minor: true` need to recreate
    their previous filter combination on top of `minimum-severity`,
    NOT just rely on the new default. The two knobs were layered
    (`ignoreMinor` filtered info+low; `minimum-severity` filtered
    everything below the configured tier), so the equivalent new
    setting depends on what previous `minimum-severity` tier you
    were filtering at. Migration examples:
    - `ignore-minor: true` + previous `minimum-severity: low` (the
      old default) → `minimum-severity: medium` (the new default).
      The previous effective filter dropped info+low, and the new
      default does the same.
    - `ignore-minor: true` + previous `minimum-severity: medium`
      → `minimum-severity: medium` (the new default). No change
      needed.
    - `ignore-minor: true` + previous `minimum-severity: high`
      → `minimum-severity: high` (NOT the new default).
    - `ignore-minor: false` (the prior default) + previous
      `minimum-severity: low` (the prior default) → accept the
      new default of `medium` to filter style/hygiene, or set
      `minimum-severity: low` explicitly to keep all findings.
    - `ignore-minor: false` + previous `minimum-severity: high`
      → `minimum-severity: high` (no change needed).
- **BREAKING**: `minimum-severity` default flipped from `low` to `medium`.
  Out of the box, low-severity findings (style, hygiene) are filtered
  out of the postable set and do not appear as inline comments. Set
  `minimum-severity: low` explicitly to keep them.
- Severity-table layout headline now leads with the **posted comment
  count** (e.g. `📊 24 inline findings`) rather than the model's gross
  output. Off-diff findings are surfaced as a separate callout
  (`> 🔍 4 off-diff findings not posted inline — the model produced
  them but they target files not in this PR's diff.`) instead of
  appearing as a "28 findings → 24 posted" math breakdown. The
  manifest still carries `inlineCount` and `suppressedCount`
  separately for downstream consumers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Initial release of the UmActually PR review action for GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.
- Bundled CLI (`bin/umactually-pr-review.mjs`) that delegates to `dist/cli.js` (built with `@vercel/ncc`).
- `UMACTUALLY_*` environment variable surface for `API_URL`, `API_KEY`, `MODEL`, `PROMPT_FILE`, `ADDITIONAL_PROMPT_FILE`, `REVIEW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `STALL_SECONDS`, `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, `SONAR_HOST_URL`, `SONAR_TOKEN`, `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY`, `INCLUDE_SONARQUBE`, `IGNORE_MINOR`, `DETECT_LEAKS`, with `REVIEW_*` retained as a backward-compatible fallback.
- `--detect-leaks` / `--no-detect-leaks` and `--include-sonarqube` CLI flags driving the S5 redaction report and the S6 SonarQube mocked report.
- Live redaction scan in `runReview` and `runAzureReview` so secret leaks always block raw output before posting.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `.nvmrc` (24), `examples/github/pr-review.yml`, and `examples/azure/azure-pipelines.yml`.
- CI smoke step that exercises the bundled CLI against the S1/S4 fixtures.
- `npm run bundle` and `npm run check:dist-freshness` scripts.

### Changed

- `src/index.ts` now wires every action input through to the CLI instead of always forcing `--dry-run`.
- `bin/umactually-pr-review.mjs` no longer falls back to `src/cli.ts`; it errors with exit code 127 when `dist/cli.js` is missing.
- `docs/configuration.md` and `README.md` document the canonical `UMACTUALLY_*` secrets, the updated defaults (`max-output-tokens=16000`, `ignore-minor=false`), and the `--no-detect-leaks` flag.
- `src/reference/verify-reference-regressions.ts` performs real input checks against fixture contents rather than tautological self-contains.
